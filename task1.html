    <h3 id="intro" style="color:green;" align="center"> WHO WAS BHAGAT SINGH? <h3>

            <p style="color:rgb(10, 4, 4);"> Bhagat Singh, (born September 27, 1907, Lyallpur, western Punjab, India
                [now in Pakistan]—died March 23, 1931, Lahore [now in Pakistan]), revolutionary hero of the Indian
                independence movement.

            </p>

            <p> Bhagat Singh attended Dayanand Anglo Vedic High School, which was operated by Arya Samaj (a reform sect
                of modern Hinduism), and then National College, both located in Lahore. He began to protest British rule
                in India while still a youth and soon fought for national independence. He also worked as a writer and
                editor in Amritsar for Punjabi- and Urdu-language newspapers espousing Marxist theories. He is credited
                with popularizing the catchphrase “Inquilab zindabad” (“Long live the revolution”).
            </p>
            <p> In 1928 Bhagat Singh plotted with others to kill the police chief responsible for the death of Indian
                writer and politician Lala Lajpat Rai, one of the founders of National College, during a silent march
                opposing the Simon Commission. Instead, in a case of mistaken identity, junior officer J.P. Saunders was
                killed, and Bhagat Singh had to flee Lahore to escape the death penalty. In 1929 he and an associate
                lobbed a bomb at the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi to protest the implementation of the Defence
                of India Act and then surrendered. He was hanged at the age of 23 for the murder of Saunders.

            <h3 id="earlylife" style="color:green;" align="center"> BHAGAT SINGH'S EARLY LIFE <h3>

                    <p style="color:rgb(10, 4, 4);"> Bhagat Singh was born on 27 September 1907 in the village of
                        Banga in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab in what was then British India and is today
                        Pakistan; he was the second of seven children—four sons, and three daughters—born to Vidyavati
                        and her husband Kishan Singh Sandhu. Bhagat Singh's father and his uncle Ajit Singh were
                        active in progressive politics, taking part in the agitation around the Canal Colonization Bill
                        in 1907, and later the Ghadar Movement of 1914–1915.

                        align="right" style="width:300px;height:200px;">
                    <p> After being sent to the village school in Banga for a few years, Bhagat Singh was enrolled in
                        the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic School in Lahore. In 1923, he joined the National College in
                        Lahore, founded two years earlier by Lala Lajpat Rai in response to Mahatma Gandhi's
                        non-cooperation movement, which urged Indian students to shun schools and colleges subsidized by
                        the British Indian government.
                    </p>
                    <p> Police became concerned with Singh's influence on youths and arrested him in May 1927 on the
                        pretext that he had been involved in a bombing that had taken place in Lahore in October 1926.
                        He was released on a surety of Rs. 60,000 five weeks after his arrest. He wrote for, and
                        edited, Urdu and Punjabi newspapers, published in Amritsar and also contributed to
                        low-priced pamphlets published by the Naujawan Bharat Sabha that excoriated the British. He
                        also wrote for Kirti, the journal of the Kirti Kisan Party ("Workers and Peasants Party") and
                        briefly for the Veer Arjun newspaper, published in Delhi. He often used pseudonyms,
                        including names such as Balwant, Ranjit and Vidhrohi.

                                    align="right" style="width:300px;height:500px;">
                                <p>In 1928, the British government set up the Simon Commission to report on the
                                    political situation in India. Some Indian political parties boycotted the Commission
                                    because there were no Indians in its membership, and there were protests across
                                    the country. When the Commission visited Lahore on 30 October 1928, Lala Lajpat Rai
                                    led a march in protest against it. Police attempts to disperse the large crowd
                                    resulted in violence. The superintendent of police, James A. Scott, ordered the
                                    police to lathi charge (use batons against) the protesters and personally assaulted
                                    Rai, who was injured. Rai died of a heart attack on 17 November 1928. Doctors
                                    thought that his death might have been hastened by the injuries he had received.
                                    When the matter was raised in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the British
                                    Government denied any role in Rai's death.</p>

                                <p>Singh was a prominent member of the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) and was
                                    probably responsible, in large part, for its change of name to Hindustan Socialist
                                    Republican Association (HSRA) in 1928. The HSRA vowed to avenge Rai's death.
                                    Singh conspired with revolutionaries like Shivaram Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar, and
                                    Chandrashekhar Azad to kill Scott. However, in a case of mistaken identity, the
                                    plotters shot John P. Saunders, an Assistant Superintendent of Police, as he was
                                    leaving the District Police Headquarters in Lahore on 17 December 1928.</p>
                                <p>Contemporary reaction to the killing differs substantially from the adulation that
                                    later surfaced. The Naujawan Bharat Sabha, which had organised the Lahore protest
                                    march along with the HSRA, found that attendance at its subsequent public meetings
                                    dropped sharply. Politicians, activists, and newspapers, including The People, which
                                    Rai had founded in 1925, stressed that non-co-operation was preferable to
                                    violence. The murder was condemned as a retrograde action by Mahatma Gandhi, the
                                    Congress leader, but Jawaharlal Nehru later wrote that:
                                    Bhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism but because he
                                    seemed to vindicate, for the moment, the honour of Lala Lajpat Rai, and through him
                                    of the nation. He became a symbol, the act was forgotten, the symbol remained, and
                                    within a few months each town and village of the Punjab, and to a lesser extent in
                                    the rest of northern India, resounded with his name. Innumerable songs grew about
                                    him and the popularity that the man achieved was something amazing.</p>

                                <p>After killing Saunders, the group escaped through the D.A.V. College entrance, across
                                    the road from the District Police Headquarters. Chanan Singh, a Head Constable who
                                    was chasing them, was shot dead by Chandrashekhar Azad. They then fled on
                                    bicycles to pre-arranged safe houses. The police launched a massive search operation
                                    to catch them, blocking all entrances and exits to and from the city; the CID kept a
                                    watch on all young men leaving Lahore. The fugitives hid for the next two days. On
                                    19 December 1928, Sukhdev called on Durgawati Devi, sometimes known as Durga Bhabhi,
                                    wife of another HSRA member, Bhagwati Charan Vohra, for help, which she agreed to
                                    provide. They decided to catch the train departing from Lahore to Bathinda en route
                                    to Howrah (Calcutta) early the next morning.</p>
                                <li style="color:rgb(181, 24, 6);">Escape from Lahore</li>

                                <p>Bhagat Singh and Rajguru, both carrying loaded revolvers, left the house early the
                                    next day. Dressed in western attire (Bhagat Singh cut his hair, shaved his beard
                                    and wore a hat over cropped hair), and carrying Devi's sleeping child, Singh and
                                    Devi passed as a young couple, while Rajguru carried their luggage as their servant.
                                    At the station, Singh managed to conceal his identity while buying tickets, and the
                                    three boarded the train heading to Cawnpore (now Kanpur). There they boarded a train
                                    for Lucknow since the CID at Howrah railway station usually scrutinised passengers
                                    on the direct train from Lahore. At Lucknow, Rajguru left separately for Benares
                                    while Singh, Devi and the infant went to Howrah, with all except Singh returning to
                                    Lahore a few days later.</p>

                                <p>For some time, Bhagat Singh had been exploiting the power of drama as a means to
                                    inspire the revolt against the British, purchasing a magic lantern to show slides
                                    that enlivened his talks about revolutionaries such as Ram Prasad Bismil who had
                                    died as a result of the Kakori conspiracy. In 1929, he proposed a dramatic act to
                                    the HSRA intended to gain massive publicity for their aims. Influenced by
                                    Auguste Vaillant, a French anarchist who had bombed the Chamber of Deputies in
                                    Paris, Singh's plan was to explode a bomb inside the Central Legislative
                                    Assembly. The nominal intention was to protest against the Public Safety Bill, and
                                    the Trade Dispute Act, which had been rejected by the Assembly but were being
                                    enacted by the Viceroy using his special powers; the actual intention was for the
                                    perpetrators to allow themselves to be arrested so that they could use court
                                    appearances as a stage to publicise their cause.</p>
                                <p>The HSRA leadership was initially opposed to Bhagat's participation in the bombing
                                    because they were certain that his prior involvement in the Saunders shooting meant
                                    that his arrest would ultimately result in his execution. However, they eventually
                                    decided that he was their most suitable candidate. On 8 April 1929, Singh,
                                    accompanied by Batukeshwar Dutt, threw two bombs into the Assembly chamber from its
                                    public gallery while it was in session. The bombs had been designed not to
                                    kill, but some members, including George Ernest Schuster, the finance member of
                                    the Viceroy's Executive Council, were injured. The smoke from the bombs filled
                                    the Assembly so that Singh and Dutt could probably have escaped in the confusion had
                                    they wished. Instead, they stayed shouting the slogan "Inquilab Zindabad!" ("Long
                                    Live the Revolution") and threw leaflets. The two men were arrested and subsequently
                                    moved through a series of jails in Delhi.</p>
                                <li style="color:rgb(181, 24, 6);">Assembly case trial</li>
                                <p>According to Neeti Nair, "public criticism of this terrorist action was
                                    unequivocal." Gandhi, once again, issued strong words of disapproval of their
                                    deed. Nonetheless, the jailed Bhagat was reported to be elated, and referred to
                                    the subsequent legal proceedings as a "drama".[38] Singh and Dutt eventually
                                    responded to the criticism by writing the Assembly Bomb Statement:</p>
                                <p>We hold human life sacred beyond words. We are neither perpetrators of dastardly
                                    outrages ... nor are we 'lunatics' as the Tribune of Lahore and some others would
                                    have it believed ... Force when aggressively applied is 'violence' and is,
                                    therefore, morally unjustifiable, but when it is used in the furtherance of a
                                    legitimate cause, it has its moral justification.</p>
                                <p>The trial began in the first week of June, following a preliminary hearing in May. On
                                    12 June, both men were sentenced to life imprisonment for: "causing explosions of a
                                    nature likely to endanger life, unlawfully and maliciously." Dutt had been
                                    defended by Asaf Ali, while Singh defended himself. Doubts have been raised
                                    about the accuracy of testimony offered at the trial. One key discrepancy concerns
                                    the automatic pistol that Singh had been carrying when he was arrested. Some
                                    witnesses said that he had fired two or three shots while the police sergeant who
                                    arrested him testified that the gun was pointed downward when he took it from him
                                    and that Singh "was playing with it." According to an article in the India Law
                                    Journal, the prosecution witnesses were coached, their accounts were incorrect, and
                                    Singh had turned over the pistol himself. Singh was given a life sentence.</p>
